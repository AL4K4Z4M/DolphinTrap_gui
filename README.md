# DolphinTrap
An evil portal generator designed to create customizable HTML login portals to work with the FlipperZero.

I am, absolutely, not a developer, coder, or anything. I am barely learning Python right now. Who I am, is someone who has a high interest in network security and ideas. This program is entirely coded by ChatGPT, which I know will turn away many people. I am not trying to mascarade as something I am not, I am simply trying to create tools that help me with my tests.
