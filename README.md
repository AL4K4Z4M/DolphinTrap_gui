#As of 9/23/2024 this project will no longer be updated. I decided to pursue creating the same program with my own knowledge and learn as I do it. That project is at https://github.com/AL4K4Z4M/DolphinTrapCLI

### DolphinTrap
An evil portal generator designed to create customizable HTML login portals to work with the FlipperZero.

I am, absolutely, not a developer, coder, or anything. I am barely learning Python right now. Who I am, is someone who has a high interest in network security and ideas. This program is entirely coded by ChatGPT, which I know will turn away many people. I am not trying to mascarade as something I am not, I am simply trying to create tools that help me with my tests.
